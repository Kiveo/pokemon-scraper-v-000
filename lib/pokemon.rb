class Pokemon
  attr_accessor :name, :type, :db, :id
  def initialize(name:, type:, db:, id:)
    @name = name
    @type = type
    @db = db
    @id = id
  end

end


#
# Confused about
# 1. What is a keyword
# 2. How does one interact with an initialize method


# OK. I didnt have an ID...so I got myself worked up. Lemme try rq please. SO SORRY about the audio
#
# LOL forgot id again   ...only diff here was missing id, so lets hope that was it.
